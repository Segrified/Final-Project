# The Stack
The stack is a very important aspect to programming. Aspects of it are found in many other data structures, and its use can be found everywhere. In this section, we will explore what the stack is, how it is used, and why it is important.

## Purpose of The Stack
The Stack data structure that is able to store data in a linear format. This is commonly related to a stack of pancakes, as you stack them starting from the bottom, and usually remove them starting from the top. The stack works very similarly, creating a list of data, and using the `pop()` function to remove the last piece of data added.
